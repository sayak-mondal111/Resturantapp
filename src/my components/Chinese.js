//                     Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular
//                     Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.[1][2] Historical events such as invasions,
//                     trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to India. The Columbian discovery
//                     of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruits. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies,
//                     peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India</p> */}
